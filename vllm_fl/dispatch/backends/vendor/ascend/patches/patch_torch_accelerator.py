"""Make PyTorch's generic accelerator memory API safe on Ascend.

PyTorch 2.10 routes several ``torch.accelerator`` memory calls through the
C10 ``DeviceAllocator`` interface.  torch-npu's caching allocator does not
implement that interface, so vLLM 0.24's ``MemorySnapshot`` otherwise fails
before model loading.  Keep the compatibility shim local to FL's Ascend
platform lifecycle and delegate to torch-npu's native memory APIs.
